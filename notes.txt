I need to perform both design as well as operational optimisation. Starting from design optimisation, I need to select control variables. Here it is:
1. Field Aperture Area/Solar multiple
2. Row spacing
3. Number of modules per assembly
4. Aperture width
5. Length of Collector assembly
6. Number of SCA per loop


Talking about control variables that we are going to consider for operational optimisation:
1. Mass flow rate
2. Startup Temperature
3. Shutdown Temperature

After all this, how we are going to perform this task

1 Mwe = 1000 kW

Find out about these variables:
1. System power generated
2. PC HTF pump power and why it is always zero?
3. System net electrical power and why it is negative of field htf pump power?
4. How to convert MWe to kWh?
5. What is PPA price multiplier? And difference between retail price and market price?

Now I am thinking how can I perform these two optimisation sequentially.

I am creating a router file that routes through both kind of optimisation

We have built operational and design optimisation logic and also how can we do it sequentially.
