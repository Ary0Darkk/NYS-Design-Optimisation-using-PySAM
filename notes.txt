I need to perform both design as well as operational optimisation. Starting from design optimisation, I need to select control variables. Here it is:
1. Field Aperture Area/Solar multiple
2. Row spacing
3. Number of modules per assembly
4. Aperture width
5. Length of Collector assembly
6. Number of SCA per loop


Talking about control variables that we are going to consider for operational optimisation:
1. Mass flow rate
2. Startup Temperature
3. Shutdown Temperature

After all this, how we are going to perform this task

1 Mwe = 1000 kW

Find out about these variables:
1. System power generated
2. PC HTF pump power and why it is always zero?
3. System net electrical power and why it is negative of field htf pump power?
4. How to convert MWe to kWh? -> 1000
5. What is PPA price multiplier? And difference between retail price and market price?

Now I am thinking how can I perform these two optimisation sequentially.

I am creating a router file that routes through both kind of optimisation

We have built operational and design optimisation logic and also how can we do it sequentially.

Now I have built design plus operational optimisation,now I need to implement seasonlity.

Today I have implement saving state of optimiser in order to resume it from there again.

I came to know that you need to import some heavy ones when you need them, means inside function body or during calling them. Imports are not declarative although they run whenever you run your code so to speed up your code, you need to import heavy libraries inside. Like matlab engine imports.

I need to learn about constraint handling and about maths behind Evolutionary Optimization algorithms.
I also need to start learning about RL optimisation.

Objective function:
obj = PC electrical power output(P_cycle)(in MWe)*1_000(in kWh/MWe) * unit price(in Rs/kWh) 
    - PC HTF Pump Power(cycle_htf_pump_power)(in MWe)*1_000(in kWh/MWe) * unit price(in Rs/kWh) 
    - Field HTF Pump Power(W_dot_field_pump)(in MWe)*1_000(in kWh/MWe) * unit price(in Rs/kWh)

I was correcting the objective function where I have mistakenly put P_out_net in place of P_cycle, and I am gettig objective function to be in thousands in case of net. It seems opposite, and we need to solve this.

And second thing as we are dealing with two parameters that are integers, means 1,2,4 like this. So we need to refactor code in order to fix this. There are two ways to handle this:
1. Pass integers to Simulation, that is probably the most correct one.
2. Another way is that as simulation is working with floats too, we can take nearest integer after optimisation.

I think we need to answer this question very carefully!
